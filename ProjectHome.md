# Introduction #
Symphony is an open-source cross-platform web browser developed using Qt/C++. It is released under the GNU GPL v3.

Symphony is designed to be an intuitive, simplistic, yet powerful web browser that any type of user can use with ease.

Symphony is being developed by one man.

## Current Version: Alpha V0.0.007 ##

# Details #
Symphony is currently in alpha, but is already very user-friendly and feature-intensive.

Symphony uses intuitive features and designs which result in a very simplistic and user-friendly web browser.
One of the highlights of Symphony's UI is its custom tab system, which, although completely unique, is designed for ease of use and intuitiveness.

Symphony is designed with all types of internet users in mind, which may vary from users whom are completely new to browsing the web, all the way over to power users who like to get the most out of their browser.

Symphony comes with built-in security features, including _NoScript_, which allows the user to pick and choose which sites to enable javascript and plugins on, as well as _AdBlock_, which blocks common ads throughout all websites.

There is a lot more to Symphony. So why not download it and give it a spin?

`Do note that Symphony is currently only available for Windows. In the near future, cross-platform versions of Symphony for both Linux and Mac OS X will be released. Do you have a computer running on Linux or Mac OS X? Want to help out? If you have experience with compiling source code, please contact the owner of this project, or make a post in our discussion group. Thanks a lot.`


## What's Going On Now? ##
Our source has just recently been reorganized, and is now released for the public to look over. Please keep Symphony's license in mind when you handle the source code. As our project page says, Symphony is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.

Information about compiling the source can be found at: [CompilingSymphonySource](CompilingSymphonySource.md)

We are always looking for ways to improve our code, so if you want to contribute, whether it be via patches, bug reporting, or something else, please do so. Any questions or comments regarding this may be posted in our discussion group. Thank you.

We are still looking for users running on either Linux or Mac OS X, who have experience in both compiling source code (C++ or/and Qt is a big plus), and preferably someone who can also test the software to make sure it is just as stable on there OS as it is for Windows. This is (preferably) not a one-time job, so if you are interested, once again, please contact us via our discussion group. Thanks a lot.
